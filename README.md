# ph.sh (photoshell)

A GTK3 application for managing photos.

## Usage

Before running `photoshell`, you will need to have a working Python 3.4
environment (including pip and virtualenv), and the dcraw utility installed. To
run `photoshell`, just do `make run` from the project directory. The first time
you launch `photoshell` it may take a few minutes to install dependencies.
