# photoshell

A GTK3 application for managing photos.

## Usage

Before running `photoshell`, you will need to have a working Python 3.4
environment (including pip and virtualenv). To run `photoshell`, just do `make
run` from the project directory. The first time you launch `photoshell` it may
take a few minutes to install dependencies.
